# stripe_tax_rate

With this resource, you can create a product - [Stripe API product documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/tax_rates).

Tax rates can be applied to invoices, subscriptions and Checkout Sessions to collect tax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// the most basic tax rate
resource "stripe_tax_rate" "tax_rate" {
  display_name = "minimalist product"
  inclusive = false
  percentage = 10
}

// the full parameter tax rate
resource "stripe_tax_rate" "tax_rate" {
  active = true
  display_name = "minimalist product"
  description = ""
  inclusive = false
  percentage = 10
  jurisdiction = "JP"
  metadata = {
    key = "value"
  }
}

```
